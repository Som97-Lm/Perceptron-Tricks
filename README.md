# Perceptron Tricks — Visual Intuition for Neural Decision Boundaries

This repository contains an interactive notebook focused on developing **intuition** for how the perceptron algorithm learns.  
Instead of implementing the algorithm from scratch, this notebook demonstrates several *tricks*, visual insights, and geometric interpretations that help you understand perceptron behavior in depth.

This complements the “Perceptron-Implementation” repository by focusing on conceptual clarity and visualization.

##  Notebook Included
- **Perceptron_trick.ipynb**

This notebook covers:
- How decision boundaries shift during perceptron training  
- Understanding margins and separability  
- Geometry of classification  
- Visualizing misclassified points  
- Effects of learning rate and iteration count  
- Tricks to interpret perceptron line movements  
- Limitations of perceptron and why some datasets fail  

---

##  Objective
To build a **strong visual and conceptual understanding** of the perceptron algorithm, specifically:
- How the boundary moves  
- Why certain updates happen  
- How errors guide learning  
- Why perceptron works only for linearly separable data  
- How to interpret training progress visually  

This notebook helps learners “see” the algorithm rather than just code it.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn (for dataset generation)
